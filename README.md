# DataAnalysis_projects
## Compilation of data analysis projects
* Palmers Penguins : This data visualization project shows that the Gentoo species is the largest penguin of the three based on an increase of flipper length to body mass relationship.
* Hairstyles Business Porject : This project analyzes the revenue generated by various hairstyles offered at a hair salon using Spyder and Python. By examining data from last week, we calculated total revenue, average daily revenue, and identified potential pricing strategies. We specifically looked at the impact of increasing the price of crew cuts from $20 to $25, which showed a 25% increase in revenue. Visualizations created using Python's matplotlib library helped to visualize key insights and support data-driven decision-making for optimizing salon revenue and marketing efforts.
