## Compilation of data analysis projects
* Palmers Penguins : This data visualization project shows that the Gentoo species is the largest penguin of the three based on an increase of flipper length to body mass relationship.
* Hairstyles Business Project : This project analyzes the revenue generated by various hairstyles offered at a hair salon using Spyder and Python. By examining data from last week, It calculates total revenue, adjusts prices with discounts, identifies affordable cuts for marketing, and visualizes trends using Matplotlib. It includes a comparison of original and new pricing impacts on revenue specifically looking at the impact of increasing the price of crew cuts from $20 to $25, which showed a 25% increase in revenue.
* CO2 Emissions Analysis: Analyzed global CO2 emissions data using R and Tableau to support environmental insights for the oil and gas sector. Built a linear regression model in R to predict CO2 emissions per capita based on energy use and GDP per capita. Enhanced an existing Tableau dashboard with a scatter plot showing actual vs. predicted emissions, highlighting oil-producing countries. This project demonstrates skills in emissions data analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboard creation.
