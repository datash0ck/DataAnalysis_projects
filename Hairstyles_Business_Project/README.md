# Hairstyles Business Project

## Objective
Analyzes a hairstyling business's pricing and revenue data (December 2022) using Python to optimize pricing strategies and identify marketing opportunities.

## Python Analysis
- **Data**: Used lists of hairstyles (bouffant, pixie, dreadlocks, crew, bowl, bob, mohawk, flattop), prices ($30-$50), and last week's cuts (2-8).
- **Calculations**: Computed total revenue ($550), average daily revenue ($78.57), reduced prices by $5 for discounts, and identified cuts under $30 (pixie, crew, bowl) for marketing.
- **Visualizations**: Created bar charts for original vs. new prices, revenue per hairstyle, and cuts last week; combined bar-line charts to compare cuts and revenue, including a scenario increasing crew cut price by $5.
- **Output**: Generated insights and visualizations saved to the script.

## Analysis Summary
- **Revenue Trends**: The crew cut, with 8 cuts last week, generated moderate revenue ($160) despite being the most popular, suggesting a price increase to $25 could boost revenue to $200. Mohawks, with 6 cuts and $300 revenue, were the top earner, indicating potential for a promotion to attract new customers.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Discounts reduced prices effectively (e.g., pixie from $25 to $20), making cuts under $30 appealing for marketing to new clients.
- **Conclusion**: Increasing the crew cut price and promoting mohawks could optimize revenue, with further ROI analysis recommended post-marketing.

## Visualizations
- Bar charts: Original vs. new prices, revenue per hairstyle, cuts last week.
- Combined bar-line charts: Cuts vs. revenue (original and with crew price increase).
