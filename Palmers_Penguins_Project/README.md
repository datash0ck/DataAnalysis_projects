# Palmers Penguins Project

## Objective
Analyzes the Palmer Penguins dataset (2023) using R to explore the relationship between body mass and flipper length, with visualizations to highlight species and sex differences.

## R Analysis
- **Data**: Used the `penguins_lter` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package, containing species, flipper length, and body mass data.
- **Visualizations**: Created a scatter plot of flipper length vs. body mass colored by species, added a smooth trend line, and generated faceted plots by species and sex using `facet_wrap` and `facet_grid`.
- **Output**: Generated interactive plots saved within the R script output (HTML format).

## Analysis Summary
- **Visualization Insights**: The scatter plot with a trend line shows Gentoo penguins have the largest body mass and flipper length, supported by a clear positive correlation across species.
- **Faceted Analysis**: Faceting by species and sex reveals size variations, with male Gentoos appearing largest, aiding in understanding species-specific growth patterns.
- **Conclusion**: The analysis confirms Gentoo as the largest penguin species, with potential for further study on environmental or sex-based factors.

## Visualizations
- Scatter plot: Flipper length vs. body mass with species color coding and trend line.
- Faceted plots: Separate views by species and by sex and species combinations.
